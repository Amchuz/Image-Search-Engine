# Personal Vaccation Image Search Engine
  
 A personal image search engine. Given our dataset of vacation photos, to make this dataset “search-able” by creating a “more like this” functionality.  
For instance, if I submit a photo of sail boats gliding across a river, our image search engine should be able to find and retrieve our vacation photos of when we toured the marina and docks.
